GO Fundamentals from :
https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests

### Hello, World
Writing tests
Declaring functions, with arguments and return types
if, const and switch
Declaring variables and constants
TDD workflow

### Integers
Integers, addition
Writing better documentation so users of our code can understand its usage quickly
More practice of the TDD workflow

### Iteration
Learned for
Learned how to write benchmarks
More TDD practice

### Arrays and slices
Arrays
Slices
    - The various ways to make them
    - How they have a fixed capacity but you can create new slices from old ones using append
    - How to slice, slices!
len to get the length of an array or slice
Test coverage tool
reflect.DeepEqual and why it's useful but can reduce the type-safety of your code
slices.Equal 

### Structs, methods & interfaces
Declaring structs to create your own data types which lets you bundle related data together and make the intent of your code clearer
Declaring interfaces so you can define functions that can be used by different types (parametric polymorphism)
Adding methods so you can add functionality to your data types and so you can implement interfaces
Table driven tests to make your assertions clearer and your test suites easier to extend & maintain

### Pointers & errors
Pointers
    - Go copies values when you pass them to functions/methods, so if you're writing a function that needs to mutate state you'll need it to take a pointer to the thing you want to change.
    - The fact that Go takes a copy of values is useful a lot of the time but sometimes you won't want your system to make a copy of something, in which case you need to pass a reference. Examples include referencing very large data structures or things where only one instance is necessary (like database connection pools).
nil
    - Pointers can be nil
    - When a function returns a pointer to something, you need to make sure you check if it's nil or you might raise a runtime exception - the compiler won't help you here.
    - Useful for when you want to describe a value that could be missing
Errors
    - Errors are the way to signify failure when calling a function/method.
    - By listening to our tests we concluded that checking for a string in an error would result in a flaky test. So we refactored our implementation to use a meaningful value instead and this resulted in easier to test code and concluded this would be easier for users of our API too.
    - This is not the end of the story with error handling, you can do more sophisticated things but this is just an intro. Later sections will cover more strategies.
    - Donâ€™t just check errors, handle them gracefully
Create new types from existing ones
    - Useful for adding more domain specific meaning to values
    - Can let you implement interfaces
### Maps
In this section, we covered a lot. We made a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) API for our dictionary. Throughout the process we learned how to:
    - Create maps
    - Search for items in maps
    - Add new items to maps
    - Update items in maps
    - Delete items from a map
    - Learned more about errors
        - How to create errors that are constants
        - Writing error wrappers
